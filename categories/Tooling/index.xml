      <description>A new release of VS Code Language Support for Apache Camel 0.0.29 is available. It includes an interesting set of new features and two important bugfixes.
API based components support Camel has several API based components which are source code generated from external API. In 3.6.0, finer grained information is available through additional metadata (Camel catalog). This release is leveraging these metadata to propose improved completion, documentation and validation for these APU based components.</description>

      <description>During the past months, several noticeable new features have been added to improve the developer experience of application based on Apache Camel. These updates are available in the 0.0.20 release of Visual Studio (VS) Code extension.
Before going into the list of updates in detail, I want to note that I mentioned in the title the VS Code Extension release because VS Code extension is covering the broader set of new features.</description>
